        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <li>
            <ol>First we need to prep the veg! Begin by chopping (enough to serve one) the red pepper, celery, carrots in julienne style.
                chop the red onion into thin rings. Chop the sugarsnap peas into smaller chunks. Chop the garlic, ginger until it becomes a paste.
                Chop the chilli into very small pieces.</ol>
            <ol>Get the frying pan (or wok) nice and hot, pour about a tablespoon of olive oil.</ol>
            <ol>Begin by frying the garlic, ginger and chilli. Make sure you stir frequently so to not burn.</ol>
            <ol>Once colour begins to appear on the garlic, throw in the red pepper, celery and carrots.
                Season with salt and black pepper.</ol>
            <ol>Once the red pepper begins to soften add a teaspoon of turmeric powder and coriander powder.</ol>
            <ol>Now add about 2-3 tablespoons of water.</ol>
            <ol>Then add the egg noodles (if you are using dry egg/rice noodles then boil them in a seperate pan and add to veg once cooked).</ol>
            <ol>Add a sprinkle of soy sauce.</ol>
            <ol>And serve with a few chopped up walnuts on top.</ol>

        </li>
