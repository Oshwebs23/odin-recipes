        <p>Spaghetti carbonara</p>
        <p>Here is the only carbonara recipe you will ever need to follow! The original, the best, traditional carbonara.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Guanciale (pancetta, bacon as subsitute)</li>
            <li>Pecerino (parmessan as subsitute)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all put a large pan of water to boil.</li>
            <li>Finally chop the guanciale into fine chunks (or bacon,pancetta).</li>
            <li>In a bowl gently whisk 3 egg yolks,grate about a handful of the pecerino(or parmessan)
                and add a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil,
                cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
            <li>Whilst the spaghetti is cooking, fry the guanciale in a frying pan. Do not add salt. Cook on a medium heat until crisp and golden</li>
            <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
                Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
            <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, 
                lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
            <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).</li>
            <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl.
                Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.</li>

        </ol>
