        <p>Slow cooked Moroccan inspired beef shin with potatoes</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        
        <ul> 
            <li>2 pieces of beef shin (preferably on the bone) like image above</li>
            <li>2 sticks of celery</li>
            <li>1 large brown onion</li>
            <li>2 large carrots</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>4 cloves</li>
            <li>Red wine of your choice (I would recommend a cabernet sauvignon)</li>
            <li>1 large orange</li>
            <li>500ml of beef stock</li>
            <li>New potatoes</li>
            

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>First we need to make sure the meat is at room temperature before cooking, so take out of fridge for about 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whilst meat is warming, roughly chop the onion, celery and carrots. And chop the garlic into a paste.</li>
            <li>Stick 4 cloves into the orange.</li>
            <li>Sear the meat in a large pan. Once brown all over, take meat out of pan but do not wash the pan. We will use this pan to fry
                rest of the incredients.</li>
            <li>Now gently fry the onions, carrots and celery and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Now add the meat back into the pan and add the beef stock and about half a bottle of red wine.</li>
            <li>Add the orange with the cloves.</li>
            <li>Cook on a medium heat for about 2 - 4 hours until meat is tender.</li>
            <li>Serve with new potatoes and veg of choice (I personally recommend tenderstem broccoli)</li>

        </ol>
