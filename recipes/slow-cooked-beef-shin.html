        <p>Slow cooked Moroccan inspired beef shin with potatoes</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        
        <li> 
            <ul>2 pieces of beef shin (preferably on the bone) like image above</ul>
            <ul>2 sticks of celery</ul>
            <ul>1 large brown onion</ul>
            <ul>2 large carrots</ul>
            <ul>1 garlic clove</ul>
            <ul>4 cloves</ul>
            <ul>Red wine of your choice (I would recommend a cabernet sauvignon)</ul>
            <ul>1 large orange</ul>
            <ul>500ml of beef stock</ul>
            <ul>New potatoes</ul>
            

        </li>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        
        <li>
            <ol>First we need to make sure the meat is at room temperature before cooking, so take out of fridge for about 10 - 15 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>Whilst meat is warming, roughly chop the onion, celery and carrots. And chop the garlic into a paste.</ol>
            <ol>Stick 4 cloves into the orange.</ol>
            <ol>Sear the meat in a large pan. Once brown all over, take meat out of pan but do not wash the pan. We will use this pan to fry
                rest of the incredients.</ol>
            <ol>Now gently fry the onions, carrots and celery and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.</ol>
            <ol>Now add the meat back into the pan and add the beef stock and about half a bottle of red wine.</ol>
            <ol>Add the orange with the cloves.</ol>
            <ol>Cook on a medium heat for about 2 - 4 hours until meat is tender.</ol>
            <ol>Serve with new potatoes and veg of choice (I personally recommend tenderstem broccoli)</ol>
